**Yang** is a scripting language designed for easy embedding in C++ programs.

Some features:
* Static typing
* Scripts are JIT-compiled to native code using LLVM for super-fast execution
* Natural, type-safe, minimal-boilerplate interop between script and host program code.

The language and API are still in early stages and very much in flux, so you probably don't want to use this for anything serious just yet.
